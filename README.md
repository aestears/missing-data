# ReadMe

 This repository contains code for our manuscript about missing data in ecological time series

### Contents
`data/` This folder contains the real population size and GPP datasets used in this analysis, the simulated datsets, the datasets with missingness introduced, and model results. 

`figures/` This folder contains the figures included in the manuscript and supplementary material, as well as the code used to generate them. 

`Functions/` This folder contains functions that are used to simulate data and fit statistical models in this analysis. 

`GPP sim and real/` This folder contains code used to generate models that are used in the analysis of GPP data. (this code may be redundant... would be good to get some input here!)

`Population sim and real/` This folder contains code used to generate models that are used in the analysis of population data. 

`Model_Runs/` This folder contains code to run models with different missing data approaches on real and simulated GPP and population time series. (this code may be redundant...would be good to get some input here!

`ModelChecking/` This folder contains code to explore and validate model approaches used in our analysis (may not need this??) 
Have you pushed changes to the gitHub repo?
`Simulations/` This folder contains code to simulate GPP and population datasets, and to generate datasets with artificially introduced missingess.
