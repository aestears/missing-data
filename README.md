 This repository contains code for our manuscript about missing data in ecological time series
 A separate gitHub repository that serves as version control for the Overleaf version of this manuscript can be found here: https://github.com/aestears/MissingDataManuscript/tree/main

### Contents
`data/` This folder contains the real population size and GPP datasets used in this analysis, the simulated datsets, the datasets with missingness introduced, and model results. 

`figures/` This folder contains the figures included in the manuscript and supplementary material, as well as the code used to generate them. 

`Functions/` This folder contains functions that are used to simulate data and fit statistical models in this analysis. 

`GPP sim and real/` This folder contains code used to generate models that are used in the analysis of GPP data.

`Population sim and real/` This folder contains code used to generate models that are used in the analysis of population data. 

`Model_Runs/` This folder contains code to run models with different missing data approaches on real and simulated GPP and population time series.

`ModelChecking/` This folder contains code to explore and validate model approaches used in our analysis 

`Simulations/` This folder contains code to simulate GPP and population datasets, and to generate datasets with artificially introduced missingess.
